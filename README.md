# Data Science Candidate Repo
PostPilot specializes in personalized direct-mail marketing campaigns to grow customer base and increase customer lifetime value. One of our key business goals is identifying consumers having the highest total spend in a specific promotional window following a campaign. Accurately modeling the anticipated spend of consumers allows us to optimize targeting, allocate marketing budgets efficiently, and maximize return on ad spend (ROAS).


## Objectives
You are given historic campaign data for a specific brand who will launch additional future campaigns. Your objective is to train a model to estimate the incremental return on ad spend (iROAS) 

$$
\text{iROAS} = \frac{\text{Total Treatment Group Spend - Total Control Group Spend}}{\text{Advertising Cost}}
$$

for each of the historic campaigns in the training data using the target variable `total_30d_post_campaign_spend`. The advertising cost associated with each campaign is the sum of the cost of each postcard mailed. _You can assume that this cost is constant across consumers and campaigns and is $0.70 per postcard mailed._ Additionally, update the provided Flask API script to serve predictions made by your model.

Implement your solution in Python, following professional coding practices (PEP8 compliance, modularity, clear function/class definitions, type hints). Provide either a script or Jupyter notebook that includes your technical analyses and findings. Your submission should include artifacts from the following:

1. Clearly define the mathematical/statistical framing of the business problem.

2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover meaningful patterns, distributions, and relationships. Visualize key distributions (e.g., target variable distribution demonstrating its heavy-tailed nature), and identify critical modeling challenges (e.g., data skewness, zero-inflation, heteroscedasticity, etc.).

3. Methodology and Modeling Choices:

    Be prepared to clearly explain:
    - the rationale behind your chosen modeling approach
    - trade-offs between predictive accuracy and interpretability
    - uncertainty quantification and robustness considerations

4. Feature Engineering & Selection:
Clearly document your feature-engineering process, especially any new features derived from raw variables (e.g., recency-weighted lifetime spend, interaction terms, embedding representations of categorical variables). _Provide justifications for the chosen features_.

5. Model Evaluation & Diagnostics:
Evaluate your model using appropriate metrics; conduct and visualize residual diagnostics to identify model strengths and weaknesses.

6. Software Engineering Practices:
Organize your work within a Git repository using best practices (meaningful commits, branches, clear PR messages).

## Evaluation
We will evaluate your work sample by using your prediction script to make predictions for each consumer in a holdout test set containing consumers targeted in future campaigns.

Your code should be environment agnostic; it should be possible to run it on any machine with a recent version of Python installed. Please be sure to give careful instructions explaining how to run your code to make these predictions.  

You will be evaluated via the following criteria:
- Readability and cleanliness of your code
- Ease of running your code to make new predictions
- Quality of analysis
